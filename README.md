## Self-Evaluation: 
(For this assignment, there was 22 exercises checked by 68 automated checks)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: For this assignment I feel I deserve 19/20 points.  The only unit test I didn't manage to pass was flowControl.js to return false if no number was provided or if the value wasn't a number.  My thought process tells me to break this entire function down into separate if statements, but I was so close with this I wanted to submit what I had obtained.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
The thing I found most interesting was the way properties are declared in ECMA6.  It has been a few years since I dabbled in JavaScript and creating the properties and function for the personObject test was really fun to work through!

### How long it took you to finish this?
~4 hours.
